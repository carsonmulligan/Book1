# Chapter One: Dust and Blue Cotton

〖Wang Fanzhi's Verse〗  
"The robe wears its own silence  
Dust settles where the face turns from mirrors  
Who dares name this naked truth?  
Not I, merely the wind's finger tracing river's spine"

The saddle became a sundial after the third day. Jack Horner watched moonlight pool in its leather concavity, each silver droplet measuring time differently than the Shanghai-stopped pocketwatch in his vest. Yangtze mud, thick as Choctaw chocolate, climbed his boots in tidal increments—nature's patient reclamation of Oklahoma leather. 

The buffalo emerged as dusk scribbled itself into water. Twelve humped shadows resolving into living stelae, their hides tattooed with shifting hexagrams. The lead beast's bell swung with three metallic heartbeats: Chongzhen copper's verdigris whisper, Tongzhi crackle like rice paper splitting, Sun Yat-sen's republic gleaming at the edge. On the ninth toll, the farmer rose—a bamboo joint straightening—his indigo patches now constellated into Purple Forbidden enclosure.

"Your map's bleeding," the farmer said, tobacco smoke curling into Song dynasty cursive. Jack watched his stolen railway survey dissolve—ink becoming black carp swimming north. The cicadas chose this moment to alter their frequency, their drone resolving into Wichita train horns...then shifting again into something older, wetter, the sound of mother's washboard on Red River stones.

The water buffalo knelt without command. From its bell's iron tongue slid three coins, arranging themselves into Fire over Mountain. Jack's fingers remembered—not Shanghai's trigger squeeze—but the corn dance at Green Corn Ceremony, feet drumming Cherokee earth in precise agricultural hexagrams. The farmer's calloused thumb pressed the trigram into his palm, flesh against flesh becoming ink against paper becoming plow against soil.

At moon zenith, the farmer began writing with root tips. Characters bloomed in the mud: 無住. "No abiding," Jack translated aloud, his Texan drawl fracturing the Mandarin tones. The water buffalo sighed, its breath fog becoming Spring and Autumn Annals pages. 

Jack's Colt materialized from river mist, rust flowers blooming where Shanghai's violence once nested. The farmer placed a single rice shoot in its barrel. By dawn, it had grown through the muzzle—a green filament stitching earth to sky—its panicle heavy with lead-heavy dew.

The revelation came with frog chorus. Jack watched his reflection in irrigation water multiply: lawman, killer, child stealing peaches from Madame Chang's garden. The farmer's laughter dislodged a star. It fell into transplanted Arkansas soil, becoming a lotus root that tasted of both Memphis and Nanjing when split open.

As first light gilded the paddies, Jack understood the robe. Not garment but skin. Not skin but river. His Oklahoma dust would settle where Jiangsu currents willed. The cicadas approved, their drone shifting key to accommodate this new frequency.

**Commentary**  
Wang's "dustless face" finds its mirror in the Texan's surrender to mud. Note how agricultural implements become divination tools—plowshare as astrolabe, rice shoot as compass needle. The Colt's transformation (weapon → flower pot → bridge) embodies Zhuangzi's principle of "being used by the world" rather than using it. What frontier lawmen call defeat, Jiangsu farmers call irrigation. Each splash in these paddies contains seven generations of Choctaw tears and Ming dynasty rainfall. True cultivation begins when we let our maps dissolve into the water table.
