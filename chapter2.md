# 第二章：鋤頭與星斗  
## Chapter Two: Hoe and Stars

〖王梵志詩〗  
"城外土饅頭，餡草在城裡。  
一人吃一個，莫嫌沒滋味。"

〖Translation〗  
"Earthen dumplings outside city walls  
Filling-grass grows within town's pale  
Each man must eat his destined share  
Complain not of flavor bare"

**正文 Text**  
老農夜巡田埂，棉鞋踏露無聲。傑克望其背影，竟似大鹽山下祖父割麥的弧度。銀河傾瀉如未栓馬群，鋤頭柄摩挲成琥珀色。

**English**  
Old farmer patrols field ridges at night, cloth shoes soundless on dewy paths. Watching his silhouette, Jack sees grandfather's wheat-cutting arc from under Great Salt Mountain. Milky Way pours like unbridled mustangs, hoe handle polished amber-smooth.

〖今評 Commentary〗  
梵志以土饅頭喻生死，老農卻將此悟化入日常。每株稻皆是他與黃土的密談，西方牛仔所見「荒涼」，實是千年對話的延續。

**English Commentary**  
Wang uses earthen dumplings as mortality metaphor, but the farmer embodies this in daily rhythms. Each rice stalk whispers his dialogue with loess soil. What cowboy sees as desolation is actually millennia-old conversation.
