# 第二章：鋤頭與星斗  
## Chapter Two: Hoe and Stars

〖王梵志詩〗  
**Original:**
"城外土饅頭，餡草在城裡。  
一人吃一個，莫嫌沒滋味。"

〖Translation〗  
"Earthen dumplings outside city walls  
Filling-grass grows within town's pale  
Each man must eat his destined share  
Complain not of flavor bare"

**正文 Text**  
鋤頭斜倚竹籬時，刃面自成八卦鏡。傑克窺見鏡中農夫化為牛背鷺鷥，而自己成了水牛眼中反嚼的星圖。蟬聲突然靜默，因天地正在換牙。

**English**  
When hoe leaned on bamboo fence, blade became Bagua mirror. Jack saw farmer transform into cattle egret, while he himself became star-chart in buffalo's cud. Cicadas paused—heaven-earth changing milk teeth.

農夫用鋤柄釣露水，每滴皆含未誕生的江河。傑克學樣，卻釣起少年時在紅河偷飲的馬匹。那馬鬃化作蘆花，馬蹄印裡游出銀鯽，鯽背刻著《莊子》養生篇。

**English**  
Farmer angled dew-drops with hoe handle, each containing unborn rivers. Jack imitated, but hooked Red River stallion from his youth. Mane became reed flowers, hoofprints spawned silver crucian carp, backs carved with Zhuangzi's "Essentials for Nurturing Life".

"看這蝸牛，"老人吹開稻葉，"殼中宮殿住著前世的鋤頭。"傑克細觀，見蝸角觸鬚正演練八極拳，而自己的掌紋在蝸殼螺旋裡延伸成田埂。

**English**  
"See this snail," farmer blew aside rice leaves, "palace-shell houses previous life's hoe." Jack peered close—antennae practicing Baji quan, his own palm lines extending into field ridges through shell's spiral.

暴雨將至，農夫倒持鋤頭接雲朵。第一滴雨含楚國編鐘之音，第二滴藏未寫的唐詩，第三滴...卻是傑克母親晾衣繩上的冰凌，融化後成了揚子江支流。

**English**  
Storm approached. Farmer caught clouds in upturned hoe. First raindrop held Chu dynasty bells, second concealed unwritten Tang poems, third...became Jack's mother's clothesline icicle, melting into Yangtze tributary.

**正文 Text**  
螢火蟲偷喝鋤刃月光醉倒，在傑克靴筒裡打鼾。農夫以草莖為其蓋被，鼾聲震落晨星，星屑入泥長出蘿蔔，個個刻著《道德經》片段——卻被田鼠當作前世情書啃食。

**English**  
Fireflies stole moonlight from hoe blade, drunkenly snoring in Jack's boot. Farmer tucked them in with grass stems. Snore-shakes dropped morning stars, stardust growing radishes carved with Dao De Jing fragments—field mice gnawed them as past-life love letters.

〖今評 Commentary〗  
王梵志的土饅頭在此化作莊周夢蝶之戲。鋤釣江河、蝸演拳法、雨藏楚韻，皆示「道在屎溺」之詼諧真諦。洋牛仔漸成濠梁觀魚者，而農夫實為曳尾塗中之龜。

**English Commentary**  
Wang's earthen dumplings transform into Zhuangzi's butterfly game. Hoe-fishing rivers, snail kungfu, rain-preserved melodies—all reveal "Dao in the mundane" through cosmic humor. Cowboy becomes fish-observer on Hao River, while farmer is the turtle dragging tail in mud.
