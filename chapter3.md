# 第三章：煙袋與懷錶  
## Chapter Three: Pipe and Pocketwatch

〖王梵志詩〗  
"他人騎大馬，我獨跨驢子。  
回顧擔柴漢，心下較些子。"

〖Translation〗  
"Others ride tall steeds  
I straddle small donkey  
Glancing back at wood-bearing man  
My heart finds balance truly"

**正文 Text**  
黃銅懷錶停在上海時刻，煙袋鍋卻按北斗方位轉動。老農教傑克用秧苗寫字：橫如扁擔豎如井繩。浦口火車鳴笛聲中，他們在泥上寫「雨」字等天。

**English**  
Brass pocketwatch stopped at Shanghai time, but pipe-bowl turns with Big Dipper's rhythm. Farmer teaches Jack to write with rice shoots: horizontal like carrying-pole, vertical like well-rope. As Pukou train whistles, they write "rain" character in mud, waiting on heaven.

〖今評 Commentary〗  
梵志的比較心在此昇華為時空對話。懷錶與星象，火車與秧字——1930年的碰撞卻暗合盛唐氣度。老農之「較」非計較，乃天地尺規。

**English Commentary**  
Wang's comparative mind here becomes dialogue across time. Pocketwatch vs stars, train vs rice-character writing—1930s collisions echo Tang Dynasty grandeur. Farmer's "measure" isn't calculation but cosmic calibration.
